[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pastjean/coveohubot.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pastjean/coveohubot)

hubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he
has, etc!

### Running hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start hubot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    hubot> hubot help
    hubot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    hubot help - Displays all of the help commands that hubot knows about.
    ...

### Scripting

- [Scripting Guide](scripting-docs).
- [hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] see`hubot-scripts.json`
- external scripts see `external-scripts.json`

### external-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead of
writing it yourself, you can use existing plugins.

Hubot is able to load plugins from third-party `npm` packages. This is the
recommended way to add functionality to your hubot. You can get a list of
available hubot plugins on [npmjs.com](npmjs) or by using `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...


To use a package, check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

## Deployment

    % heroku create --stack cedar
    % git push heroku master

If your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable
and add the Redis to Go addon to your app.

    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

You'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.

More detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto
Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
